This folder contains code pertinent to the heart rate monitor project. All of the latest code is in the wavelet folder. The final versions of the program for the Arduino-based heart rate monitor are locate in wavelet/Arduino. hrm_wavelet_clean_v03 seems to work the best. The different version numbers are due to slightly different algorithms and different approaches to averaging noise in the signal.
